# 3D Animation

Computer animation is the art of creating moving images via the use of computers. It is a subfield of computer graphics and animation.

## Applying 3D animation

First you need to define variable as `class` attribute. For instance, if we want to create animation by rotating an object, we need to define `angle` variable with initial value. Then in `display()` method, we change that angle as required by increasing or decreasing. Then apply rotation using update angle. This is can be applied to translation, scaling or any kind of drawing. As long as `display()` method called it will result different action.
